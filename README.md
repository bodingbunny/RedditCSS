Stylesheet for /r/pics
reddit username: boding_bunny
The submission contains the .css file and images.

I tried to create a clean, organized, and modern look for the subreddit. 
Some details: 
- every link including its rank, score, title, thumbnail, etc. appears as one object
- various link-hovers have been edited
- custom hover-images for neutral voting arrows
- changes for RES have been made
- custom night mode
- new style for the rules in the sidebar
- other minor changes

I used the typical reddit colors, since /r/pics is one of the largest subreddits and I think it shouldn't look too different from the default style. Of course, all colors can be changed if desired. Also, the ranks of the links could be removed, but I thought this could encourage voting.
